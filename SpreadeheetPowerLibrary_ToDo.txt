Work on simple amortisation table  (I have started under Functions / Standard)

Create a loan amortisation table.  See 
https://powerpivotpro.com/2016/02/reviewlist-generate-create-tables-thin-air-power-bi-m/


Create a query fn_std_Single_OnlyTableInSpreadsheetSelectedColsOnly
 - maybe rather work into fn_ConsolidatedFilesInFolder - that way it can work across multiple source types
 - useful for large datasets when I dont want to agregate entire datatable before selecting on or 2 columns
  - Same as fn_std_Single_OnlyTableInSpreadsheet except add a list parameter


Query Example_FilledDataMissingDates
 --> Cant fill forward after expansion as there is a risk filling across items
 --> May need some sort of list.generate or list.accumulate function?

Conditional formatting for YTD and MTD in pivot table? --> Yes this is possible

- In respect of the missing lookups measure and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to false, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing

- Create a readme

- Don't forget to use DAX studio for debugging, performance measurement and measure creation
   Dax studio F6 for format or Ctrl F6 for short form formatting
